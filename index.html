                    I love building products and sharing them with others. I am
                    specialized in Deep Learning for Computer Vision and my
                    current focus is using my technical skills and empathy for
                    users to build end-user products. I love being independent
                    and I get excited about new opportunities and curious
                    people, which made my startup the most productive work
                    environment for me :)

                      - App which allows users to remove people from their
                      photos. Think holiday photos with tourist in the
                      background. Mostly powered by React Native and Deep
                      Learning (GANs) in the cloud.

                      <a href="https://deepbuster.com">DeepBuster</a> - Web
                      application which allows users to detect videos with
                      manipulated faces and voice. An idea that was slightly too
                      early, but surely a very useful tool in the future.
                      Powered by Vue and more Deep Learning (mostly ConvNets).

                      <a href="https://chameleon.id/">Chameleon</a> - Another
                      web application which helps video editing artists automate
                      creating object masks before applying special effects on
                      those objects. Cool idea, but video editing does not
                      personally excite me too much. Powered by React.js and a
                      combination of GANs and ConvNets.

                    <li>
                      <a href="http://getsoul.app/">Soul</a> - Mobile app, which
                      enables users to communicate via anonymous videos. By
                      changing the face and voice of recorded videos, users do
                      not have to worry about online harassment and can safely
                      express the true themselves. Powered by Expo and again a
                      combination of GANs and ConvNets.

                    Born and raised in Estonia, I have a pragmatic approach to
                    life and an interest in tech. I have always loved learning
                    about pretty much anything and I am grateful to having so
                    many amazing teachers in my life. My journey has taken me to
                    many places around the world and I am currently enjoying my
                    every moment in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.
