                  <p>
                    I love building products and sharing them with others. I am
                    specialized in Deep Learning and my main interest is using
                    my technical skills and love for good UX to build magical
                    consumer products. I love being independent and I get
                    excited about other ambitious people, which makes me
                    naturally a huge fan of startups. In fact, I am currently
                    working on my next one as part of Entrepreneurs First.

                    <li>
                      AntiBuddy - App which allows users to remove people from
                      their photos. Think holiday photos with tourist in the
                      background. Mostly powered by React Native and Deep
                      Learning (GANs) in the cloud.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      DeepBuster - Web application which allows users to detect
                      videos with manipulated faces and voice. An idea that was
                      slightly too early, but surely a very useful tool in the
                      future. Powered by Vue and more Deep Learning (mostly
                      ConvNets).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Chameleon - Another web application which helps video
                      editing artists automate creating object masks before
                      applying special effects on those objects. Cool idea, but
                      video editing does not personally excite me too much.
                      Powered by React.js and a combination of GANs and
                      ConvNets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <a href="https://www.getsoul.app/">Soul</a> - Mobile app,
                      which enables users to communicate via anonymous videos.
                      By changing the face and voice of recorded videos, users
                      do not have to worry about online harassment and can
                      safely express the true themselves. Powered by Expo and
                      again a combination of GANs and ConvNets.

                      <a href="https://rocketbase.ai/">RocketBase</a> - A SaaS
                      platform for using pre-trained machine learning models
                      with five lines of python code. Rocketbase makes it
                      possible to integrate and retrain a deep learning solution
                      on both mobile and cloud with 2 minutes of coding.

                    Born and raised in Estonia, I have a pragmatic approach to
                    life and an interest in tech. I have always loved learning
                    about pretty much anything and I am grateful to having so
                    many amazing teachers in my life. My journey has taken me to
                    many places around the world and I am currently enjoying a
                    colorful life in Berlin, Germany.
